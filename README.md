Nik's Data Portfolio

Hi!! Welcome to Nik's Github repository for all coding related projects. 
To date I have only completed one project, in which I analysed a dataset
of AFL players' match statistics to predict a player's goal-kicking using
regression analysis. You can view this in this repository. 

Feel free to check out my other projects at linktr.ee/nikbuchnerdata

Cheers !
